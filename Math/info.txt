Mathematics is a formal science whose common definition is the study of patterns and structures. Using strictly logical reasoning, mathematics makes statements (theorems) about defined objects and formulates the relationships between them. Mathematics Wiki is under construction!

Computer Science originated and grew from Mathematics, which is why it is logical that both directions share some subjects. Until Tuyaux Mathematics is converted to wiki format, all these subjects can be found here .
